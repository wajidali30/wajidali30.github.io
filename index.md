# 👋 Welcome to My Page

I am **Wajid Ali**, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the **University of Liverpool, UK**. My work bridges mathematics, biology, and data science through the development of mathematical models to understand real-world systems such as epidemics, evolution, and human behaviour.

---

## 🔬 Research Interests

My research focuses on **stochastic and deterministic modelling** of biological and social systems, including:

- Epidemics and vaccine hesitancy
- Eco-evolutionary dynamics, conservation and behavioural ecology
- Evolutionary game theory and network-structured populations
- Time series forecasting and machine learning
- Genomic data analysis
